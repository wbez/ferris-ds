    “I couldn't help but wonder about the name. How did it originate? Was it
    half a day's journey walking or riding a horse from some place to another;
    to Topeka, eight miles south, for instance? I know that there are streams on
    trails through the area that are named because they mark distances. For
    example, 110 Mile Creek on the Santa Fe Trail. But that's more exact. Half
    Day, like Elmont, is so unspecific.”
